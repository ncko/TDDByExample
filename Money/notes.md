## Todo

- $5 + 10 CHF = $10 if rate is 2:1
- ~~$5 * 2 = $10~~
- make "amount" private
- Dollar side effects?
- Money rounding?

## Lessons
- The problem is dependency (between the code and test). The sympton is duplication. Get rid of the duplication, and you get rid of the dependency and end up with more generalized code.
- TDD is about *being able* to take teeny-tiny steps. When things get weird, you'll be glad you can.
